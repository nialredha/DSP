# Convolution Reverb 
Goal: take an audio file and convolve it with an impulse signal, using the
FFT, to create a reverb effect. 

Currently: built delay line and comb filters to make a Schroeder reverberator.
The plans is to move to convlolution reverb afterwards. I will likely need to 
change the name of the application to something more general, like 
"Reverberation".
