# Understanding the Discrete and Fast Fourier Transform


## Foreword
Before reading this document, I would highly encourage you watch the 3B1B
video on the fourier transform. I will be using a lot of the language used in 
that video, especially when attempting to explain the concepts behind the 
algorithm (e.g. the idea of winding a signal around a circle). 

Not to mention, Grant Sanderson (3B1B) is an incredilbe educator and builds 
elegant visuals to help understand notoriously challenging concepts. So, you
should be watching his videos regardless of if it helps you understand what
I have to say here. Anyways, click on the image below to watch the video.

## Introduction
Assuming you have watched the video, I am going to walk through what the 
Fourier Transform is and how it can be descritized and run on a computer. 
However, I am not going to speak on why it's useful or how it can be applied - 
partly because it is ovbious in some respects and also because I think it is
interesting all on its own.

I am going to start by briefly going over what the Fourier Transform is trying
to accomplish and how it goes about doing so - this will be done using 
continuous space. Afterwards, I will move into discrete space and talk about 
how you can compute the transform along with the pitfalls of doing so.
Finally, I will discuss how to overcome the major pitfall of the DFT - i.e.
computation time - using the FFT.

For the time being, I do not see this resource as educational for anyone but
me. Ultimately, however, my goal is to explain these topics in a way that is helfpul and
helpful and interesting to other people.
