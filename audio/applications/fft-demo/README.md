# Understanding the Discrete and Fast Fourier Transform


## Foreword
Before reading this document, I would highly encourage you watch the 3B1B
video on the fourier transform. I will be using a lot of the language used in 
that video, especially when attempting to explain the concepts behind the 
algorithm (e.g. the idea of winding a signal around a circle). 

Not to mention, Grant Sanderson (3B1B) is an incredilbe educator and builds 
elegant visuals to help understand notoriously challenging concepts. So, you
should be watching his videos regardless of if it helps you understand what
I have to say here. Anyways, click on the image below to watch the video.
